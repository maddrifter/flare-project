Flare
=================
Flare, the love child of Snapchat and Pokemon Go lures, is a social mobile app for sharing spontaneous moments based on where you are.

Imagine you're having an awesome time at a house party, found a great pop-up restaurant or you've just stumbled across Lady Gaga playing a surprise gig in a local bar. Our app allows you to capture that moment as a photo or video and send it up as a time-limited flare. These flares can then be viewed instantly on a map by friends or other nearby users who can then come and join in.
